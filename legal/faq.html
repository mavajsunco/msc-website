                <p>Think of web hosting as renting a piece of land to build an online presence. When you buy web
                    hosting, you are buying space and resources on a server, needed to build and present a website.
                    MAVAJ SUN CO's web hosting plan gives you not only the space, but also a ton of support features,
                    tools and expert support so you can have the website of your dreams.</p>

                    If I don't already have a website with MAVAJ SUN CO, how do I transfer my website to MAVAJ SUN CO

                <p>Transferring a website to MAVAJ SUN CO is simple and fast. Here are the 4 basic steps to do so:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure not to cancel your old web hosting account right away.</li>
                    <li>Set up your email addresses on our servers to match what you had previously.</li>
                    <li>Upload your site's files into your new /public_html directory. As your domain name is not yet
                        connected to your MAVAJ SUN CO account, you will need to use the IP address provided in your
                        Welcome email.
                    </li>
                    <li>Change the DNS settings with your registrar. You can also request a domain transfer at <a
                            href="mailto:sale@MavajSunCo.com">sales@MavajSunCo.com</a>.
                    </li>
