<h1>Information Architecture</h1>

<p>As interactive designers, MAVAJ SUN CO always keep an eye on the user journey--how can we give visitors a visually stimulating and functional web experience so we started by studying the (Information Architecture) and redesigning it from the customer's point of view. From accessing information to making decisions, the idea was to give control to the customer through optimized navigation. We created large spotlights in the middle of the page to help position branding prominently while also giving the customer an easy to use functional space to browse around. Instead of spanning across multiple pages, information was consolidated and packaged within a Thick Box.</p>
<p>This helps in simplifying decision making for customers. From the clientâ€™s perspective, plans and services offered were of utmost importance, so designs were tailored around them. Also adding footer at the bottom of the screen was a simple way to enable easy navigation.</p>
