<h1>Blog Development</h1>

<p>A corporate blog can be an effective marketing device. While all blogs provide a venue for quick publishing and water cooler-type dialogue, there are two major kinds. Each provides very different benefits to your organization.</p>
<p>An external blog, which is accessible to the Internet, is a powerful public relations tool. Infused with corporate flavour yet more informal than a press release, the information published in this setting builds brand authority.</p>
<p>Many external blogs have taken the place of published newsletters companies historically would provide their regular and prospective customers.</p>
<p>The blogs often provide information on company offerings and initiatives, give valuable advice, and reinforce the company's identity.</p>
<p>An internal blog is available only on a company intranet to employees and, optionally, selected associates. Often this is a platform for thought leaders to share their vision. It can also be a forum for corporate evangelists or experts to talk about the business of your business.</p>
