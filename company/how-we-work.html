<h1>Our Progress</h1>
<h2>there's more to web design than building web pages</h2>
<p>Our job is to guide you through the process, and to make your business work at its best on the web. We do not offer a "one size fits all" package: we believe that for a website to be a success it requires a highly skilled team (that’s us!) who are fully invested in the project and have a close relationship with the client.</p>
<p>Anything is possible; the most successful websites are built from the ground up with detailed and explicit planning from start to finish. We take an active role in your project from the very beginning; assisting and advising in regards to content, structure, hierarchy, functionality and layout. We make sure the finished product is delivered to specification, on-time and on-budget.</p>



<h1>Discover</h1>
<h2>understanding your goals is the first step to achieving them together</h2>
<p>The first stage is to discuss your project in detail. This is where you tell us exactly what you are aiming to achieve and we sit with you to fully understand you and your goals. At this point we share our expertise and exchange ideas in order to ensure you have as much information as possible on how we can make your project work to its fullest online.</p>
<p>Together, we can then tailor our approach and give a clear indication of time and cost estimates. Many of our projects are divided into phases and also include a long term growth plan.</p>


<h1>Plan</h1>
<h2>meticulous planning keeps your project on track</h2>
<p>MAVAJ SUN CO create comprehensive project plans which outline our findings from the discovery phase. Proposals include crucial details about how your project will be managed and just how each individual element will be designed and built to meet your goals.</p>
<p>Most projects begin with sketched wireframe designs that describe the pages, components and layouts. Once you are happy with the layout, these wireframes are designed professionally to demonstrate how the website will appear on different devices.</p>



<h1>Create</h1>
<h2>take advantage of our world-class design and development team</h2>
<p>There is a huge amount to consider during the build of a website, but thanks to the previous stages our developers will already have a thorough understanding of what is required from the build. We make sure everything has been thought through, constructed properly and tested across multiple devices.</p>
<p>As well as creating websites, our multi-disciplinary designers have vast experience designing supporting media too, so we can provide both digital and traditional marketing materials which all convey your brand and message effectively across all platforms.</p>



<h1>Grow</h1>
<h2>let's start a journey together.</h2>
<p>After you have experienced our unique process of discovery, planning and construction, you’ll have strong foundations. This makes it simple to build on in the future. Almost all of our clients continue with us after the initial project launch for aftercare, maintenance and brand new exciting projects.</p>
